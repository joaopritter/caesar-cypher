# Caesar Cypher Practice

## About
Whenever studying new languages/ technologies, I like to practice by using them
to write a Caesar cypher script without using external libs, since it usually relies 
on concepts like data structures, iteration, writing reusable code, etc.

This is a repository to store these practices.

## Done

- [x] Python
